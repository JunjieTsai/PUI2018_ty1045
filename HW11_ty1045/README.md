## PUI HW11

### Assignment 1. Work from the skeleton notebook with inline instructions.
### Assignment 2. Improve your plot from HW8 based on the feedback you recieved from your classmates (let me know if you did not recieve feedback and I will comment on your original plot)

In this part of the assignment, I am implementing a graph using HW7's internet access data by puma as I found it to be really fascinating. I am ploting a graph of Estimated Total Internet Subscriptions, using the key B28002_001E. Based on review from my classmates, I create the legend so that the scale information can be clearly viewed.
