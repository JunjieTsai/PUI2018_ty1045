Hi Gabriel,

    Nice plot and good work in general! It's smart and fun to use the data by PUMA from HW7 because they are structured data that give a lot of information about NYC. Your plot covers the 5 boroughs in NYC and has a clear color pattern. It would be even clearer if you include the vertical color bar, or the legend, in your plot to show that yellow represents higher number of internet subscription in a PUMA area and dark blue does the other way. But yellow and dark blue in a color scale are good enough to show high and low quantities and avoid confusion for color blind viewers. Your plot would be also better off if you include some more description or observation of your graph in the caption below it. Like "we see higher numbers of internet subscription by PUMA area in downtown and midtown Mannhattan, Long Island City, and Flashing. The numbers of internet subsciption are low in suburban areas in Bronx, Brooklyn, and Staten Island". Your plot did honestly reproduce the data to show the overall total internet suscriptions per PUMA area in NYC!
